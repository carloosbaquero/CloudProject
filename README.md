## Installation from Source Code
### Dependencies:
- **NodeJs**. See the official installation guide [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- **MariaDB**. Relation database used in the development of this project (another relational database can be chosen if it is supported by the ORM Sequelize). 
Official installation guide [here](https://mariadb.org/download)
- **Optional** *Docker* (if you want to use the custom docker images that are implemented). Official installation guide [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

The first step in the installation on the localhost from the application source code, is the configuration of the environment that the application would use.

Then we have to do the installation of all the dependencies of each respective microservice, which are defined in their respective package.json files. Where we used the node packager manager npm.


``` bash 
npm install
```
